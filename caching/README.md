# Caching

Caching is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it back when requested. When a web server serves a web page, it stores a copy of the page in the user's computer. If the user requests the same page again, the server can serve the page without generating the page again. By doing this, the server spends less time generating the page. Thus, the web page loads faster.
